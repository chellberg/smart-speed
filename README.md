Smart Speed is a project I've been thinking about for several years, but only recently felt capable of tackling. 

Problem: When you're driving in a familiar area, you have a good idea of how much you can/should speed on any given road. I want to tear down this geographic information barrier by crowdsourcing the speed intuition possessed exclusively by observant drivers on roads familiar to them. 

Smart Speed seeks to use this crowdsourced intuition to find out what speed limit is actually being enforced by police. This will obviously be a rough figure, as such enforcement is dependant upon road and weather conditions and the discretion of individual police officers. However, I think having even a rough idea of where the line is will help drivers avoid crossing it, and hopefully feel more comfortable toeing it. 

I think having a better idea of the 'real' speed limit will actually make Smart Speed users safer, as they will be devoting more of their attention to driving safely and less to looking for speed traps. I also believe this solution is superior to radar detectors, which are expensive and illegal in some states, because a radar detector really feels like a tool to help you thwart the law by avoiding the officers enforcing it. They make you feel like a criminal.

In contrast, I want Smart Speed to make people feel like good citizens - better aware of the speeds police feel are unsafe, and thus able to comply with such limits without driving 55 in a 55 like a loser. 

My initial idea for Smart Speed was to extrapolate the recommended speed entirely from user-submitted speeding ticket information. This is still part of the plan, but I think this approach neglects a potentially valuable source of speed intuition - people like me who speed as safely and smartly as they can and have never received a speeding ticket. With this in mind, I also plan to allow users to suggest their own recommended speeds for areas they're familiar with. 

This way, Smart Speed can get data from the kind of people who think about speeding smartly and not just the ones who have actually gotten tickets. 

Ideally, Smart Speed could speed-map a medium sized town based on the contributions of just a handful of interested users, and improve upon the map with each additional user suggestion. 

For mapping data, I will be using either the Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap/Overpass, whichever I can figure out first.
